# FPL Optimization Tools

This repository provides a set of tools for solving deterministic **Fantasy Premier League (FPL)** optimization problems.
The Python code uses **`pandas`** for data management, **`sasoptpy`** for building the optimization model, and **HiGHS** via **`highspy`** to solve the model.

It allows users to:

- Automatically select the best FPL squad based on the given projection data and solver settings.
- Customize squad constraints, formation rules, transfer strategies, and more.
- Modify data sources and parameters to suit personal models or preferences.

## üîß Installation

### 1. Install Python

**Windows**

Download Python (preferably `python3.13` or later) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
During installation, **make sure to check the box that says `Add Python to PATH`**.

**macOS**

You can install Python via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if it‚Äôs not already installed:

```bash
brew install python
```

### 2. Install Git

**Windows**

Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and accept all default installation options.

**macOS**

Git is usually pre-installed. If not, run:

```bash
brew install git
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal (search for *Command Prompt* in Windows) and run:

```bash
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/sertalpbilal/FPL-Optimization-Tools
cd FPL-Optimization-Tools
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.
Install `uv` and then install the necessary dependencies for this project.

**Windows**

```bash
pip install uv
uv sync
```

**macOS**

```bash
brew install uv
uv sync
```

## üöÄ Running the Optimizer

### 1. Add Projection Data

Place your projections file (e.g., `solio.csv`) in the `data/` folder.

### 2. Configure Data Source

If you are not using the default data source, update the `datasource` field in `data/user_settings.json` to match your CSV file name.

Example: if you are using a file named `projections.csv`, the settings file should contain:

```json
"datasource": "projections"
```

### 3. Edit Settings

Edit any desired settings in `comprehensive_settings.json` or `user_settings.json`.

- The majority of useful settings for most people will be in `user_settings.json`.
- `comprehensive_settings.json` provides a wider range of options that will be used as defaults unless altered in `user_settings.json`.

Details of what each setting does can be found in the `.md` file in the `/data/` folder.

### 4. Run the Solver

```bash
cd run
uv run python solve.py
```

## üé• Videos

There is a YouTube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrIyJJU8_viOags1yudB_wyafRuTNs1Ed) by Sertalp, showing the early stages of this tool, explaining how it was built, and discussing ideas around optimization with a focus on FPL.

## üåç Browser-based optimization

There is also a browser-based version of the optimizer that doesn't require the download or installation of anything to your device, and works on mobile. It is hosted in a google colab notebook that can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fwYcG28zpIOJf7R8yx31bDL_kJG1JRLu). Simply follow the instructions on that page to run the optimizer.
